# Cron-Action-Job

Example how to use github action to run a cron job.
See [cron-job.yml](./.github/workflows/cron-job.yml) on how to set up the workflow cron job, which in turn runs `$ node [script.js](./script.js)` on a regular schedule.
You can see the  results under the [actions tab](https://github.com/Fraasi/action-test/actions?query=workflow%3Acron-job.yml)
